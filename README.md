## Chris Hutchinson

After 17 successful years working for HSBC in a variety of roles spanning Business Analysis, Data Analysis and Project Management, I was ready for a new challenge.

Through self-exploration it soon became clear that Software Development is where my future lies. Coding will enable me to channel my love of making things and my enthusiasm for solving problems.

In my career, I have had lots of positive experiences working with development teams but have always felt envious that they were the ones coding and building the applications. It amazes me what can be achieved with code and it something I want to be doing on a day-to-day basis. I want to play a part in developing high quality products that really make a difference to peoples lives.

I am currently learning to code at the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech), an intensive 16 week developer bootcamp, where I am learning the skills that will help me become a world class Software Developer.

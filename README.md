## About me

After 17 successful years working for HSBC in a variety of roles spanning Business Analysis, Data Analysis and Project Management, I was ready for a new challenge.

I was enjoying working with development teams on a number of projects but felt envious that they were the ones writing the code and building the applications. It suddenly dawned on me, **why couldn't that be me?**

Fast forward 6 months and having recently graduated from the **[Makers Academy](https://makers.tech)**, where I learned how to produce high quality test-driven code, I am excited and energised to embark on my next career chapter as a **Full Stack Software Developer**.

As a passionate and curious problem solver who loves working with others, I am looking to join an Agile team, where I can apply my rapidly developing tech skills to play a part in building high quality products that really make a difference to peoples lives.

## Skills

### **Innovative Problem Solver**

A primary driver for my switch into Software Development is due to my love of making things and enthusiasm for solving problems.

At HSBC, I regularly employed my problem-solving skills to champion more effective ways of working by quickly delivering low-cost and high-quality technology solutions using Microsoft Visual Basic and SQL. Enhancing my coding skills through self learning, they were deployed to over 25 countries and used by 3k employees over a 5-year period.

Throughout the Makers course, I was pushed out of my comfort zone with challenges that tested technical and logical thinking. I enjoyed tackling the weekend solo challenges by breaking down problems into a series of small manageable elements and enhanced my problem solving tool kit by developing a consistent debugging process to help resolve issues.

### **Excellent Communicator**

In my roles as a Business Analyst and Project Manager, I effectively communicated with a wide range of stakeholders across multiple geographies to spearhead the design and delivery of a range of innovative technology and data solutions.

This included project managing a global system migration where I acted as the communication channel between developers and the business, translating end user needs into technical requirements and directing the ambitious 6-month solution delivery to 30+ sites.

As I pivot into Software Development, I have been able to apply my strong communication skills during pair programming, group projects and when volunteering to lead an end of project retro for our Makers cohort.

### **Empathetic Team-player**

I thrive when working within a team on a shared goal and am always on hand to support others to ensure everyone is getting the most out of the experience.

Adopting a nurturing leadership approach when managing a team based in India, we created a reputation for delivering an excellent quality of service to the 25+ markets that we supported and I was proud to oversee a high proportion of the team in gaining promotions at HSBC.

When working as part of an Agile team in group projects and during the more formal learning weeks, if someone in my Makers cohort needed support, I made sure I was available to help them get through their blocker.

### **Fast and Independent Learner**

In my previous career within Financial Services, through self learning, I became an expert in a variety of tools such as MS Excel, MS Access and MS Sharepoint. I used these technologies to implement a Global Coaching framework which helped pinpoint specific coaching activity, contributing to a 7% improvement in the departments Customer Service results.

The pace of learning during the Makers Bootcamp was intense but I relished the process. I was able to pick up a second language, Javascript, in a few days and taught myself how to test drive new features using the MERN stack on the [**Acebook**](https://github.com/ChrisHutchinson1982/acebook-mern-priceless) and [**Ecoliday**](https://github.com/ChrisHutchinson1982/Ecoliday) projects.

Now that I have graduated from Makers, I am eager to learn as much as possible so that I keep growing as a developer. I am excited to work on new challenges, gain new knowledge and use my existing skills to enhance my future projects.

## Interests

**My Kids**

I am a proud father of two. It is amazing seeing the world through two sets of new eyes and I am hoping to tap in on their imagination for some interesting coding projects.

**DIY**

I am a DIY enthusiast and adore the process of making and creating. I take great pleasure in teaching myself a new skill and perfecting it over time through practical application (doing!).

**Sport**

I enjoy most sports, especially football. I am long suffering Everton supporter and play a weekly game of 5-a-side with friends. I am also a keen hiker, raising £3,500 for charity by climbing Kilimanjaro as well as completing The Four Inns Challenge (40 mile hike) in the Peak District.

**Music**

Music has been a huge part of my life. I have played in a number of bands, releasing a few records and playing gigs all over the UK as well as a few in Europe. While I lived in Sheffield, I organised a weekly band night with a group of friends where we hosted bands such as the Artic Monkeys.

**Environment**

I am a lover of the natural world and being outdoors. I am really passionate about the future of our planet and was proud to create the [**Ecoliday**](https://github.com/ChrisHutchinson1982/Ecoliday) webapp as part of final project at Makers to promote eco-friendly travel plans.
